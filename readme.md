## Timer cat

Timer cat is my idea from design to implementation. There are two mode: light and dark. When the user closes the tab, the timer remembers which mode was turned on last and, when reopened, immediately switches the mode to the last state. The cat's eyes can follow the cursor and blink, cat sleeps when the timer is on and meows when the time is over. Timer is drawn with only html and css, responsive.
